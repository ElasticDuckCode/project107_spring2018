# ECE 107 Spring 2018 Capacitor Project
## Written by Jake Millhiser & Lina Yi 
Program that does the following:
* Finds Capacitance using descritized calculation.
* Plots a represenation of charge density on the surface of a capacitor using color and 3D.
* Plots capacitance vs separation distance using both the descritized calculation and the standard capacitance formula.
